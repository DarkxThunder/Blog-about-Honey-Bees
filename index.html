            <h1>Blog about Honey Bees.</h1>
            <h4>
                A honey bee(also spelled honeybee) a eusocial flying insect within the genus Apis of the bee clade, all native to mainland Afro-Eurasia.
                After bees spread naturally throughout Africa and Eurasia, humans became responsible for the current cosmopolitan distribution of honey bees,
                introducing multiple subspecies into South America (early 16th century), North America (early 17th century), and Australia (early 19th century).

            <h4>
                Honey bees are known for their construction of perennial colonial nests from wax, the large size of their colonies, and surplus production and storage of honey,
                 distinguishing their hives as a prized foraging target of many animals, including honey badgers, bears and human hunter-gatherers.
                 Only 8 surviving species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 43 subspecies, though historically 7 to 11 species are recognized.
                 Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                The best known honey bee is the western honey bee, (Apis mellifera), which was domesticated for honey production and crop pollination.
                 The only other domesticated bee is the eastern honey bee (Apis cerana), which occurs in South, Southeast, and East Asia. Only members of the genus Apis are true honey bees,
                 but some other types of bees produce and store honey and have been kept by humans for that purpose, including the stingless bees belonging to the genus Melipona and the Indian
                 stingless or dammar bee Tetragonula iridipennis.
                 Modern humans also use beeswax in making candles, soap, lip balms and various cosmetics, as a lubricant and in mould-making using the lost wax process.

                Etymology and name.
            </h1>
            <h4>
                The genus name Apis is Latin for "bee". Although modern dictionaries may refer to Apis as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass asserts that correct usage requires two words, i.e., honey bee, because it is a kind or type of bee. It is incorrect to run the two words together, as in dragonfly or butterfly, which are appropriate because dragonflies and butterflies are not flies.
                 Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project.

                Origin, systematics, and distribution.
            </h1>
            <h4>
                Honey bees appear to have their center of origin in South and Southeast Asia (including the Philippines), as all the extant species except Apis mellifera are native to that region.
                 Notably, living representatives of the earliest lineages to diverge (Apis florea and Apis andreniformis) have their center of origin there.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                The first Apis bees appear in the fossil record at the Eocene–Oligocene boundary (34 mya), in European deposits.
                 The origin of these prehistoric honey bees does not necessarily indicate Europe as the place of origin of the genus, only that the bees were present in Europe by that time.
                 Few fossil deposits are known from South Asia, the suspected region of honey bee origin, and fewer still have been thoroughly studied. 
            </h4>
            <h4>
                No Apis species existed in the New World during human times before the introduction of a mellifera by Europeans.
                 Only one fossil species is documented from the New World, Apis nearctica, known from a single 14 million-year-old specimen from Nevada.
            </h4>
            <h4>
                The close relatives of modern honey bees – e.g., bumblebees and stingless bees – are also social to some degree, and social behavior is considered to be a trait that predates the origin of the genus.
                 Among the extant members of Apis, the more basal species make single, exposed combs, while the more recently evolved species nest in cavities and have multiple combs, which has greatly facilitated their domestication.
